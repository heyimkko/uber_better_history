Uber Spender
===================

http://k5o.github.io/uber_spender/

Uber's trip history dashboard suspiciously lacks a lot of convenient information, leaving you to wonder how much did I spend on rides this year or how much do I spend per month? Uber Spender is a Chrome Extension designed to help answer those questions.

Uber Spender takes your trip history data and packages it into an easy-to-read format, giving you all the information you need. By understanding your ride expense history, you can attempt to limit your spending.

### Usage (for development)
1. Clone the repo locally
2. On Chrome, in your extensions page (chrome://extensions), Load Unpacked Extension, select the uber_spender dir
3. Log into your Uber Dashboard (https://clients.uber.com/#!/dashboard)
4. Click on the Uber Spender toggle link (be sure to first load all trips at the bottom)
