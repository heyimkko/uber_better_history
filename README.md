UberBetterHistory
===================

Uber's trip history dashboard suspiciously lacks a lot of convenient information, leaving you to wonder how much did I spend on rides this year or how much do I spend per month? Uber Spender is a Chrome Extension designed to help answer those questions.

Uber Spender takes your trip history data (don't worry, nothing is saved) and packages it into an easy-to-read format, giving you all the information you need. By understanding your ride expense history, you can attempt to limit your spending. Or, just download this so you can boast about your baller habits.
