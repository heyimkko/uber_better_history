Uber Spender
===================

Uber's trip history dashboard suspiciously lacks a lot of convenient information, leaving you to wonder how much did I spend on rides this year or how much do I spend per month? Uber Spender is a Chrome Extension designed to help answer those questions.

Uber Spender takes your trip history data and packages it into an easy-to-read format, giving you all the information you need. By understanding your ride expense history, you can attempt to limit your spending.

## Usage
1. Log into your Uber Dashboard here: https://clients.uber.com/#!/dashboard
2. Click on the Uber Spender toggle link (be sure to first load all trips at the bottom)
